# Storage WG Lead - Reporting Requirements

*Pre-proposal Discussion https://testnet.joystream.org/#/forum/threads/370, https://testnet.joystream.org/#/forum/threads/461*

*Based on the KPIs https://blog.joystream.org/sumer-kpis/#10.7*

### Storage WG Lead requested to report once a week 
- this report should include a spotcheck that each provider is working (checking through Atlas or some other means).
- A run of HELIOS
- A full breakdown of system specs for each storage provider
- Bandwidth use on each provider
- Periodic upload tests
- Free space of each one of the storage workers

It may be easier for the lead to require the storage providers to install some form of system monitoring solution, and then they can also report free space.
