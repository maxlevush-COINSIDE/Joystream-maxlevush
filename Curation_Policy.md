# Curation Policy

*Sumer network*

The main task of the `Curator Workers` and `Curator Lead` is curating the content on [Joystream Player](https://play.joystream.org)

Only Content Working Group can `warn` or `censor` videos

## 1. `Warn` video

### Which video can be `warned`

1.1 Missing thumbnail

- If the thumbnail is missing, or just really poor, or have low quality, the video can be issued a `warning`

1.2 Wrong license

- If the Curator suspects, but is not able to verify that a video is incorrectly licensed, a `warning` can be issued, leaving the channel owner some defined deadline to respond and provide more information or evidence.

1.3 Content not as "advertised"

- If the title, description, category and thumbnail imply a baking video, the video should not be a documentary about Bitcoin

1.4 Poor quality

- If the video quality is "unreasonably" low
