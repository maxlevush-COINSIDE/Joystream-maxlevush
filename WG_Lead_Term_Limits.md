# WG Lead Term Limits

*Based on the KPIs https://blog.joystream.org/sumer-kpis/#10.11*

*Pre-proposal Discussion https://testnet.joystream.org/#/forum/threads/372*

### For current Leads the term limit (starting from when this proposal is approved) is 1 month.

After this period has ended the lead could stay on as: 
- a worker
- a guide

Guide -  for the newly hired lead to guide them on how to manage the position for a week. 

### The retired lead reward

- full rate payment for a period of 1 week, to help the new lead transition into the role
- spending proposal to give the retired lead a reward (if lead will successfully complete the training period of a new lead)

*The criteria for understanding the success of the training will be presented and discussed on the forum first*

*You can only become a guide if you have successfully completed the term with all requested reports. The number of reports will be approved via proposal*

### Re-elections

One person cannot be in a role for more than 1 month in a row. You can be re-elected for a new term only after the position has been taken by another user for a month.
