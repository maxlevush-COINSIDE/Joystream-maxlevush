# WG Lead Term Limits

*Based on the KPIs https://blog.joystream.org/sumer-kpis/#10.11*

*Pre-proposal Discussion https://testnet.joystream.org/#/forum/threads/372*

### For current Leads the term limit (starting from when this proposal is approved) is 1 month.

After this period has ended the lead could stay on as: 
- a re-hire lead 
- worker
- a guide

Guide -  for the newly hired lead to guide them on how to manage the position for a week. 

### The retired lead reward

- full rate payment for a period of 1 week, to help the new lead transition into the role
- spending proposal to give the retired lead a reward (if lead will successfully complete the training period of a new lead)

*The exact criteria for the transition period between the old and new lead will be discussed on the forum first and issued as a text proposal for approval by the council*

*You can only become a guide if you have successfully completed the term with all requested reports. The number of reports will be approved via proposal*

### Re-elections

In the event the lead is still in mid-process of implementing something important, they can create a text proposal with a description of what they're working on to allow for a one-time 2 week extension to their term


- After 1 month, an opening will be made for new applicants for the lead position 
- once the review period starts, a proposal can be created to fire the lead with the reason "1 month term limit" if any user wants to 
- the council can at this point decide whether to fire the previous lead and hire a new lead, or to keep the previous lead in place

The community can create proposals with reasoning, and the council can decide how they want to vote on them
