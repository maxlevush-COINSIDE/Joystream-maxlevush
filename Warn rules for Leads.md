As part of the recent KPIs (https://blog.joystream.org/sumer-kpis/#10.7) the council is required to come up with conditions under which a lead can be fired and/or slashed.

## WARN/SLASH/FIRE rules

1. The warning is given in free form by council secretary (or/and deputy secretary) in the Discord council and operations/content-curator/storage-provider channels.
2. The warning is given after approved text proposal.

- If the Lead goes AFK with no prior explanation for 3 days he can be warned.
- If the Lead isn't responsive for further 2 days after approved warn-proposal, council could slash 25% of funds. 
- If the Lead isn't responsive for a further 1 day after approved slash-proposal, then council could fire them.
- If the Lead fails to produce a report they should be warned.
- If the Lead fail to produce two reports in a row they can be fired.
- Any malicious/fraudulent activity = firing + slashing
