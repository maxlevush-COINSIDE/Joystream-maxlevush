As part of the recent KPIs (https://blog.joystream.org/sumer-kpis/#10.7) the council is required to come up with conditions under which a lead can be fired and/or slashed.

Pre-proposal thread: https://testnet.joystream.org/#/forum/threads/460 

## WARN/SLASH/FIRE rules

1. The warning is given after approved text proposal. The warning can be issued by anyone

- If the Lead goes AFK with no prior explanation for 4 days he can be warned.
- If the Lead isn't responsive for further 2 days after approved warn-proposal, council could slash 25% of funds. 
- If the Lead isn't responsive for a further 1 day after approved slash-proposal, then council could fire them.
- If the Lead fails to produce 2 (two) reports they should be warned.
- If the Lead fail to produce 3 (three) reports in a row they can be fired.
- Any malicious/fraudulent activity = firing + slashing

## Indulgence for new Leads

*rules for a probationary period*

- During the probationary period, the council gives a little more flexibility so that they can deal with what is required before considering serious action.
- After upgrades or high workloads, you should probably expect some reports and things to be delayed, if the presenter provides a reasonable explanation and is even sociable, then some element of leniency should be provided.
